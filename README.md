# A Global-Analysis of Mental Health Resources and-Suicide Rates
The primary objective of this project was to investigate the statistical relationship between a country's investment in mental health resources and its national suicide rates. 
Mental health is a critical component of global well-being, yet the resources allocated to it vary significantly across nations. Suicide remains a major public health concern worldwide, and understanding its complex drivers is essential for crafting effective prevention strategies. Data-driven analysis offers a powerful lens through which we can explore the potential impact of public health investment on this critical outcome.
This project aims to investigate the relationship between a country's investment in mental health infrastructure and its corresponding suicide rates. The central question of this analysis is: Do countries with more extensive mental health resources, such as a higher density of psychiatrists, psychologists, and specialized facilities, demonstrate lower suicide rates?
To answer this, the project will unify and analyze four distinct datasets from the World Health Organization (WHO):
Human Resources: Quantifies the availability of mental health professionals.
Facilities: Details the infrastructure for mental health care.
Age-standardized and Crude suicide rates: Provide the outcome metrics, broken down by country, sex, and age group.
The core methodology will involve merging these datasets by Country to create a comprehensive global overview. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), this project will uncover patterns, visualize correlations, and derive insights into the tangible impact of mental health resources on a global scale.
