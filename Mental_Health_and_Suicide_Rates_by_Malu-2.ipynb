    "Further analysis of the descriptive statistics reveals deeper insights. The median (50%) number of psychiatrists and psychologists is critically low, at approximately 1.1 per 100,000 people, indicating that half the reporting countries have virtually no specialized care, and the global average is heavily skewed by a few well-resourced nations. The data also points to a structural trend in healthcare models, with a significantly higher average of outpatient facilities (1.77) compared to mental hospitals (0.24), reflecting a global shift towards community-based treatment. On an encouraging note, a comparison of the mean suicide rates from the year 2000 (12.16) to 2016 suggests a gradual but noticeable worldwide decrease. Finally, the data highlights a dramatic spike in suicide rate variability (std) for the 80 and above age group, signaling this demographic as a critical and highly varied challenge for public health policy.\n",
    "Final Conclusion We have successfully transformed four disparate files into a single, powerful dataset ready for in-depth analysis. The initial findings highlight a landscape of incomplete data and profound global inequality in mental health provisions. The next step is to clean this dataset and apply statistical models to test our central hypothesis: to what extent does greater investment in mental health resources correlate with lower suicide rates?\n"

    "This project investigated the relationship between mental health resources and suicide rates on a global scale by unifying four distinct WHO datasets. To handle the significant amount of missing data in the resource columns, median imputation was used to avoid bias from the highly skewed data distribution. Extreme outliers, reflecting global inequality, were managed by applying a logarithmic transformation, which prepared the dataset for modeling without discarding valuable information.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Linear Regression model was trained, and its reliability was confirmed through cross-validation, where it proved more effective than more complex alternatives like Random Forest. The final model achieved a highly significant R-squared of 0.342.\n",
    "\n",
    "This result means that 34.2% of the variation in suicide rates can be explained by the availability of mental health resources and the sex of the population. The primary conclusion is that investment in mental health infrastructure is a strong statistical predictor of suicide rates, successfully validating the project's hypothesis."

    "2.  Geography matters. The map makes it clear that where a country is located is linked to its suicide rate. It shows us where the biggest problems with suicide rates are.\n",
    "3.  Connecting to our other findings: The map shows us the \"where\" of the suicide rates. Our previous work (with models and numbers) told us about some things that might be linked to these rates, like mental health help and if a country is male or female dominated (explaining about 34% of the differences). The map shows that the places that need more help might be in certain areas.\n",

    "So, the map helps us see the geographical side of things, confirming that location is important. When we look at the map along with our findings about mental health help and other factors, it gives us a better picture of the complicated issue of suicide rates around the world. The map shows us where the problem is, and our numbers give us clues about what might be connected to it, but there are still many other things that play a role."

    "this map confirms the broader pattern of global inequality but also reveals important subtleties. It suggests that different countries employ different strategies for providing mental health care, with some prioritizing community-based facilities. This visual evidence supports our model's finding that this specific type of investment has a protective association."

    "## Final conclusions:\n",
    "This project set out to answer a critical question: is there a measurable relationship between a country's investment in mental health resources and its suicide rates? After a comprehensive analysis, the answer is a resounding, though complex, yes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through a linear regression model, which I rigorously validated with cross-validation, I determined that 34.2% of the variation in global suicide rates can be explained by the availability of mental health resources and gender. This is a statistically significant finding that confirms the project's central hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "My analysis revealed several key insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "Gender as a Dominant Factor: The model identified gender as the most powerful individual predictor, confirming the greater vulnerability of the male population, a pattern consistent with global public health data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Efficacy of Community Care: Crucially, I found that investment in outpatient and community care facilities is associated with a reduction in suicide rates, suggesting that policies focused on accessible and decentralized services are an effective strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Paradox\" of Specialized Resources: The model also uncovered a \"paradoxical\" relationship where a higher concentration of psychiatrists correlates with higher suicide rates. This apparent contradiction does not imply causation but likely reflects \"reverse causality\": the most specialized resources are concentrated in regions where the problem is already most severe.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main challenge of this project was the quality and lack of data on resources in many countries, which underscores the critical need to improve global reporting systems for more accurate future analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, this analysis has transformed complex and dispersed data into a clear conclusion: although there are no one-size-fits-all solutions, strategic investment in mental health, especially at the community level, is a key and measurable factor in addressing the global challenge of suicide."
